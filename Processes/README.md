This modified script does the following:
It uses the graphviz library to create a visual representation of the process tree.
The create_graph function recursively builds the graph structure, creating nodes for each process and edges 
to represent parent-child relationships.

In the main block, after building the process tree, it creates the graph and renders it as a PNG image file named 'process_tree.png'.
When you run this script, it will generate a PNG image file visualizing the process tree. Each node in the graph 
will represent a process, showing its name, PID, and creation time. The edges between nodes represent 
the parent-child relationships12.

The visualization will be similar to the tree structure we discussed earlier, but in a graphical format. It will show:
Each process as a node with its name, PID, and creation time.
Parent-child relationships as arrows pointing from parent to child processes.
The overall hierarchy of processes running on your system.
This visual representation can be particularly helpful for understanding the structure of running processes, 
identifying parent-child relationships, and spotting any unusual process hierarchies that might indicate potential 
security issues12.
Remember that generating this visualization might take some time, especially on systems with many running processes,
and the resulting image could be quite large and complex for systems with numerous processes
